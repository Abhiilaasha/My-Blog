API Data Fetching
The API uses Express.js to define various routes corresponding to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing blog posts. It utilizes in-memory data storage for simplicity, with routes implemented to handle different HTTP methods.

For instance, the GET /posts route fetches all posts, POST /posts creates a new post, PATCH /posts/:id updates an existing post, and DELETE /posts/:id removes a post by its ID.

The data is stored in an array within the server and manipulated accordingly based on the API requests received.</p>
